Integrated Library System supports some of the key functionality of a modern library. This includes registering user and admin accounts, searching for a book via normal and enhanced search functions, managing book borrowing, returning and reserving popular books as well as paying late payments and fines.  This project makes use of Python as the main programming language. Also, MySQL and MongoDB are used as databases for the programme to provide both SQL and NoSQL databases which could help store data in a much more efficient manner.
